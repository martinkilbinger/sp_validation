"""Image-simulation orchestration: raw SKiLLS sim images -> shear m/c bias.

The sp_validation-side half of the split described in
``UNIONS-WL/MultiBand_ImSim#1``: ShapePipe turns the simulated tiles into
per-tile shape catalogues (``pipeline``, ``merge``), then sp_validation
extracts, calibrates and measures the multiplicative/additive shear bias
(``manifest``, ``extract``, ``calibrate``, ``m_bias``).

One image runs the whole chain: the sp_validation image is built ``FROM`` the
ShapePipe image, so it carries both stacks.  Everything else is parameterised
under ``config["image_sims"]`` -- repository roots, data roots, the PSF
dictionary, the explicit ``tile_ids`` list and the sim/calibration knobs -- so
a fresh user drives it from config alone.  Configuration is fail-fast: a schema
check at load rejects an unknown key (typo) and a missing science key (see
``workflow/image_sims/config.yaml`` for the operational/science split).

The five simulations per grid are the reference ``1z2z`` (no input shear) plus
the ``+/-`` shear pairs ``1p2z``/``1m2z`` (g1) and ``1z2p``/``1z2m`` (g2); the
m-bias estimator matches each to the reference by RA/Dec.

    # the job, so host and job need compatible snakemake versions. They are not:
