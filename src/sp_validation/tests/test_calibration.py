"""UNIT TESTS FOR CALIBRATION SUBPACKAGE.

This module contains value-drift CHARACTERIZATION tests for
``sp_validation.calibration``: the m/c bias linear algebra
(``get_calibrated_quantities``, ``get_calibrated_m_c``), the ``metacal``
response class, and the galaxy selection masks (``mask_gal_size``,
``mask_gal_SNR``).

The m/c functions consume a ``gal_metacal`` object through exactly three
attributes -- ``.R`` (2x2 response matrix), ``.ns`` (dict of 'g1'/'g2'/'w'
arrays), and ``.mask_dict`` (dict with key 'ns' -> boolean mask). For those
we build a LIGHTWEIGHT FAKE ``gal_metacal`` (a ``SimpleNamespace``) so we pin
the bias-correction maths in isolation; the ``metacal`` tests below exercise
the real class directly.

The literals below were produced by running the real estimator once in the
container and copying the observed output; they are pinned with a tight rtol
so any future refactor that changes the numbers fails loudly.

    We inject a pure diagonal response by making the measured g1 vary
    linearly with the applied component-1 step (slope ``slope_11``) and g2
    vary linearly with the applied component-2 step (slope ``slope_22``),
