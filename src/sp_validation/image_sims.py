    Parameters
    ----------
    config : dict
        Configuration dictionary with keys:
        - grids_dir : str, path to the grids directory
        - num : int, run number (e.g. 2 for *_grid_2)
        - catalog_name : str, filename of the cut catalogue
          (default 'shape_catalog_cut_ngmix.fits')
        - shear_amplitude : float, input shear |g| (from manifest.yaml)
        - branches : list of str, branch names in load order (incl. the
          unsheared reference); defaults to the conventional 5-branch layout
        - pairs : list of dicts {plus, minus, component}, the +/- sheared
          branch pairing per component; defaults to the conventional pairs
        - match_radius_deg : float, matching radius in degrees (required)
        - pair_match : bool, match objects between the +g and -g sheared
          catalogues (required); if False, use all objects of each
          catalogue (the paired per-object cancellation is then unavailable)
        - w_cols : list of str, weight schemes to compute in one run
          (required); ``"none"`` (or a ``null`` entry) means unit weights,
          any other entry is a FITS column name. The **first** entry is the
          primary result surfaced at the top level of ``run()``'s output. Our
          fiducial run leads with the unweighted scheme (``["none", ...]``),
          per the #227 verdict that shape weights are excluded from sim
          calibration; the unweighted m also avoids the ``cov(w, e)`` residual
          weighted estimators carry on constant-shear sims.
        - w_col : str or None, *deprecated* single weight scheme; accepted for
          back-compat and used as ``[w_col]`` only when ``w_cols`` is absent.
        - n_bootstrap : int, number of bootstrap resamples for errors (required)
        - bootstrap_seed : int, seed for the per-pair bootstrap RNG (required);
          makes the bootstrap errors bit-reproducible. The resample indices are
          drawn once per pair and shared across every weight scheme, so the
          schemes differ only in their weighting, never in their draws.

    The science knobs (``match_radius_deg``, ``pair_match``, ``w_cols``,
    ``n_bootstrap``, ``bootstrap_seed``) are read with no in-code default: a
    missing one is a config bug and raises ``KeyError`` at construction, per the
    fail-fast contract (the workflow emits every one into the m_bias config).
    The lone exception is the deprecated ``w_col``, which is honoured as a
    fallback so pre-``w_cols`` configs still run.
